### Overview
Tesseract is an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine developed by Google. OCR is the technology that enables machines to recognize and extract text from images or scanned documents. Tesseract is widely used for various applications, such as document analysis, text extraction from images, and automated data entry.

Python-tesseract is a Python wrapper for Tesseract, providing a convenient interface to use Tesseract OCR functionality in Python scripts. This wrapper simplifies the integration of Tesseract into Python applications, making it easier for developers to leverage OCR capabilities in their projects.
