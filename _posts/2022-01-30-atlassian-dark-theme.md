## Overview

I use Atlassian services every day as part of my work.
In particular, I make extensive use of `Bitbucket`, `Confluence`, and `Jira`.
At the time of this writing, Atlassian does not support dark mode, at least not at the level of an individual user,
which is a bummer.

To overcome this I found a workaround that works for _me_. I am mainly using the Firefox browser on Ubuntu. There is a
Firefox plugin (aka, add-on) called `Stylus` which provides a set of themes specific to a domain. `Stylus` has a number
of themes for atlassian services. Specifically, I use the `"Bitbucket Dark Mode"` theme for Bitbucket,
and I use the `"Conway - Atlassian"` theme for Confluence and Jira. They are not perfect but they mostly work,
plus you can turn these themes on and off seamlessly.
