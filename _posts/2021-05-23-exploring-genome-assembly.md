Recently, I had to understand the basics of genome assembly. I found the following youtube videos very helpful.

Video series by Dr. Loren Launen:

[//]:  #### Genome assembling glossary
A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that
is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25â€“50 bp) data sets.

### Genome assemblers software

There are several genome assembler software packages that differ in Programming Language (PL), size of
reads (short of long) and support for error correction.

|Genome Assembler | PL | Reads | Error correction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|[SPAdes](https://github.com/ablab/spades)| C++ | Short and Long | Yes |
|[Velvet](https://github.com/dzerbino/velvet)| C | Short | Yes |
|[SOAPdenovo2](https://github.com/aquaskyline/SOAPdenovo2)| C | Short | Yes |
|[Raven](https://github.com/lbcb-sci/raven)| C++ | Long | No |
